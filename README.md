# FMCG-Analysis

## Overview

#### This project analyzes transactional sales data from an e-commerce company to uncover insights related to product performance, promotional effectiveness, stock availability, and sales trends. The analysis is designed to support stakeholders such as sales, marketing, supply chain, and regional managers in making data-driven decisions.


## Business Questions
This project explores the following key questions:
1. Top-performing products: Which product categories or brands drive the most revenue and unit sales?
2. Promotional impact: How do promotions affect sales across different SKUs?
3. Stock vs. sales: Are stock issues or delivery delays affecting sales performance?
4. Channel efficiency: Which sales channels are most effective for specific product segments or regions?
5. Seasonal patterns: What are the sales trends across weeks/months and regions?
6. Delivery impact: Is there a correlation between delivery day and units sold?
7. Underperformers: Which products perform poorly despite being well-stocked or frequently promoted?

## Executive Summary
#### Overview of Findings
1. Strong Start, Declining Momentum: The business experienced strong revenue growth in the first half of the year (January to June), as seen in the green bars of the YTD vs PYTD waterfall chart. However, performance declined steadily in the second half, with consistent revenue drops from July to November, signaling a need to investigate seasonal demand or operational constraints.

2. Channel and Product Contribution: Yogurt was the top-performing product, contributing the highest revenue (3M), followed by Milk and SnackBar. Retail remains the dominant channel, but E-commerce and Discount channels also contributed notably, suggesting multi-channel engagement is working.

3. Opportunities in Promotions and Stock: Promo sales contributed 25.3% of total revenue, and stock availability stood high at 97.9%, indicating strong operational efficiency. Yet, the business could benefit from revisiting promotion strategies during declining months to maintain momentum and drive unit sales.
