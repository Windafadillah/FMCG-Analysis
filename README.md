# FMCG-Analysis

## Overview

#### This project analyzes transactional sales data from an e-commerce company to uncover insights related to product performance, promotional effectiveness, stock availability, and sales trends. The analysis is designed to support stakeholders such as sales, marketing, supply chain, and regional managers in making data-driven decisions.


## Business Questions
This project explores the following key questions:
1. Top-performing products: Which product categories or brands drive the most revenue and unit sales?
2. Promotional impact: How do promotions affect sales across different SKUs?
3. Stock vs. sales: Are stock issues or delivery delays affecting sales performance?
4. Channel efficiency: Which sales channels are most effective for specific product segments or regions?
5. Seasonal patterns: What are the sales trends across weeks/months and regions?
6. Delivery impact: Is there a correlation between delivery day and units sold?
7. Underperformers: Which products perform poorly despite being well-stocked or frequently promoted?

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
1. Strong Start, Declining Momentum: The business experienced strong revenue growth in the first half of the year (January to June), as seen in the green bars of the YTD vs PYTD waterfall chart. However, performance declined steadily in the second half, with consistent revenue drops from July to November, signaling a need to investigate seasonal demand or operational constraints.

2. Channel and Product Contribution: Yogurt was the top-performing product, contributing the highest revenue (3M), followed by Milk and SnackBar. Retail remains the dominant channel, but E-commerce and Discount channels also contributed notably, suggesting multi-channel engagement is working.


3. Opportunities in Promotions and Stock: Promo sales contributed 25.3% of total revenue, and stock availability stood high at 97.9%, indicating strong operational efficiency. Yet, the business could benefit from revisiting promotion strategies during declining months to maintain momentum and drive unit sales.

## Insights Deep Dive
### 1. Top Performing Products

- Yogurt dominates the FMCG portfolio, contributing over 40% of total revenue, indicating strong consumer preference or effective positioning.
- Milk and SnackBar are evenly matched, suggesting balanced market performance and possibly interchangeable consumer choice behavior.
- Juice has the lowest revenue contribution, despite being part of the core category. This could indicate:
      Poor distribution or availability
      Low demand
      Weak promotional support.

In addition, we can see the revenue trend that indicates:
- Revenue peaked in May and July (0.80M) with the highest unit sales, showing strong seasonal consumer demand during mid-year.
- The Retail channel consistently drove the highest portion of revenue across all months, followed by E-commerce and Discount channels.
- From August onwards, there's a clear downward trend in revenue and unit sales, possibly linked to:
      Reduced promotions
      Seasonal drop in demand
      Stock limitations or marketing fatigue

Recommendation: 
- Analyze marketing activities, stock levels, and external factors (e.g., holidays, economic shifts) during H2 2024 to mitigate similar drops in 2025.
- Focus product innovation and marketing efforts on Juice or consider repackaging or repositioning if strategic fit is confirmed.

### 2. Promotional Impacts
- Promotions drive volume but not always revenue: Across all years, promo-driven unit sales (blue line) generally peak during promotional months, but the corresponding revenue gains vary—highlighting possible discounting impacts.
- 2023 was the most promotion-heavy year: Promo sales peaked mid-year (especially June–July), aligning with the highest revenue months—indicating effective promotional execution.
- In 2024, promotions stabilized: While promo unit sales were steady, revenue increased gradually, suggesting improved pricing strategies or less discount-driven dependency.

#### Key Takeaways
- Promotions were most impactful in 2023, driving short-term spikes in both revenue and volume.
- 2024 shows strategic maturity—more revenue with stable promo activity suggests better brand pull or pricing optimization.
- The lack of sustained growth after promo peaks in 2022 and 2023 points to the importance of post-promo retention strategies.
